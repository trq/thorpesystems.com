Recently I've been back into developing my framework <a href="http://proemframework.org" title="PHP5.4 MVC">Proem</a> and I just thought I'd share a simple yet effective little <a href="http://vim.org">vim</a> trick.

At this point in time during the development of <a href="http://proemframework.org" title="PHP5.4 MVC">Proem</a> I need to create a lot of files. Because all my classes need the license in the header, after while copying and pasting was becoming pretty tedious. This is where templates in <a href="http://vim.org">vim</a> come in handy.

Create a directory in your ~/ called .vim-templates and drop a bare bones template in it. Mine looks like:

<pre lang="php">
<?php

/**

namespace Proem\;

/**

 */
class
{
    /**

     */
    public function __construct()
    {

    }

}
</pre>

This is a good starting point for a class in <a href="http://proemframework.org" title="PHP5.4 MVC">Proem</a>. Now, in my ~/.vimrc file I can tell vim to use this template whenever I create a new php file within <a href="http://proemframework.org" title="PHP5.4 MVC">Proem's</a> lib directory.

<pre lang="vim">
autocmd BufNewFile $HOME/src/proem/lib/Proem/*.php 0r $HOME/.vim-templates/proem.class.php
</pre>

So now, whenever I use vim to create some new php file within $HOME/src/proem/lib/Proem it will use the above template. Just add as many as you need to whatever locations you like.

<h2>Conditionally including vim configs</h2>
Because I don't necessarily wan't this rule to be applied where ever I am (and because I use the same .vimrc file on multiple different machines both at home and at work) I like to wrap specific functionality into conditionals that check to see what machine I'm on.

<pre lang="vim">
if hostname() == 'dev'

    " proem
    autocmd BufNewFile $HOME/src/proem/lib/Proem/*.php 0r $HOME/.vim-templates/proem.class.php
    autocmd BufNewFile $HOME/src/proem/tests/Proem/*.php 0r $HOME/.vim-templates/proem.test.php

    " Other dev specific stuff
endif
</pre>

This checks to see if I'm running vim from within my dev box at home and if so creates the autocmd rules that make sense for that environment. I have other for work, and other various server I maintain.
